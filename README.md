## 📖 1. Introduction

This project presents an **optimized implementation of 3D Attention U-Net** for multi-class glioma segmentation on the **BraTS 2020** dataset.

Rather than introducing unnecessary architectural complexity, we focus on improving optimization behavior and training stability. Our ablation experiments (3-fold, 50 epochs) demonstrate that these refinements yield smoother convergence dynamics, particularly for the challenging Tumor Core (TC) region.

### 🚀 Key Refinements

We introduce three strategic modifications to the standard architecture:

1.  **Instance Normalization:** Replaced Batch Normalization to ensure stable feature scaling under micro-batch ($N=1$) 3D training.
2.  **LeakyReLU Activation:** Adopted to maintain gradient flow in low-activation regimes, which are common in hypointense MRI regions.
3.  **Calibrated Attention Gates:** Implemented a positive bias shift ($\beta \in [1.5, 2.0]$) to improve early feature transmission and mitigate premature gate saturation.

## 🛠️ 2. Method: The "Open-Gate" Strategy

The core innovation lies in our handling of the **AttentionBlock**. This block filters skip-connection features, allowing the decoder to focus on task-relevant information.

### The Problem: Suboptimal Gradient Flow

In standard **Attention Gates (AGs)**, zero-bias initialization often leads to low initial sigmoid activations. This can cause:

- **Feature Suppression:** Important encoder features are prematurely attenuated before the model learns to identify relevant spatial regions.
- **Convergence Instability:** The initial "closed-gate" state restricts the flow of gradients, making it difficult for the model to exit local minima in early epochs, particularly in high-variance regions like the Tumor Core.

---

### The Solution: Weighted Bias Initialization

To ensure more stable convergence dynamics, we shift the initial state toward a more **permissive configuration**:

- **Mechanism:** By setting the affine bias $\beta \in [1.5, 2.0]$, the initial gate activation is shifted to $\alpha \approx 0.82 \text{--} 0.88$.
- **Result:** This "near-open" state ensures that encoder features pass through almost freely during the initial phase.
- **Optimization:** Instead of struggling to "open" the gate, the model focuses on refining the attention map, leading to a much smoother loss trajectory and sustained performance gains in later epochs.
